### Project Name: Happy Habits
### Team Name, Team Number: The Code Compilers, Team 20
### Github Link: https://github.com/csc301-2024-s/deliverable-1-20-bellwoods-strategic-capital/tree/main 

### Project Summary:
_Provide a short summary of the project. Capture details like what problem it aims to solve and what are the key contributions of the project._

### Introduction & Overview of the problem and the product:
Thrive: Happy Habits is a mobile application designed to boost mental health and well-being through gamified happiness exercises. It aims to solve the issue of people pushing their mental health aside (due to other priorities in their busy lives) by simplifying the process of practicing happiness exercises by spending just a few minutes a day on their application. It targets increasing user positivity by guiding them through personalized mood-boosting tasks, called “Quests”  focused on gratitude and empathy. It also incorporates collaborative elements such as adding “accountability buddies” and sharing progress on quests with them. This is aimed at creating a supportive community around the app and mutual encouragement to complete quests between users. 

### Demo of the application:
The project's introduction gives a clear understanding of the app’s purpose and the benefits of the core features of the app. They gave a few examples throughout the demo of the types of quests that the users could set for themselves and how they could keep up with those quests through the gamified features. However, I thought that it could benefit from a more detailed description of the specific problem it addresses, without assuming the audience understands the need for it in the market. While it's clear that Thrive aims to boost mental health, mentioning the gap in current solutions or the specific needs of its target audience could provide a clearer pretense for the app. For example, they could discuss how many existing apps may don’t prioritize the importance of community like the Thrive app does or they don’t engage their audience enough through techniques like gamification. Briefly mentioning these could help the viewers of the demo understand why Thrive’s solution is relevant. 

For the most part, it was very clear what the team had developed this semester and what were existing features, but it could have been made more clear and presented in a structured matter. It was not as clear in the demo what was worked on by previous teams and what they had implemented until after they finished presenting a feature. In some parts of the demo they would jump from feature to feature very fast, leaving very little room for a deeper understanding of the feature and what they implemented; only making brief comments like “by the way, this was also a D1 user story that we implemented”.

### Technical Discussion & Key Learnings:
The demo certainly was comprehensive and took us through all the features they implemented in an acceptable level of detail. The different members of the group clearly had a thorough understanding of their work. Also, the app itself was very intuitive and it was easy to follow along. I believe I got a very comprehensive understanding of the app due to its intuitive nature. However, at times it was rather convoluted and did not flow well. As mentioned in the previous section, they would jump from feature to feature fast and were not very detailed about why how their features addressed their user stories. This was not too much of an issue as the intuitive nature of the app made it easy to understand the features they implemented. I can tell that a lot of effort has gone into keeping the interface consistent and engaging, which I believe boosted the quality of their demo significantly. 

The demo covered a lot of ground and showcased most of the required features as outlined in their D1 write-up in a streamlined demonstration. However, some of the key features were not demonstrated. For example, they did not show the process of receiving notifications for daily quests, and one of the acceptance criteria for their notifications feature in their D1 writeup. They demonstrated the notifications for live chat so I don’t see why they couldn’t do the same for quest reminders, with it being a main feature. Their readme does fully outline this feature, but it would have been more effective to display this feature in the demo. One area for improvement could also be in showing the breadth of the personalization features; they did not go into much detail about the filters and the different tags that the app organizes quests into; they mentioned an algorithm for personalizing the user algorithms they implemented personalizing user experiences in both D1 and their readme “Make use of the information collected by the surveys to personalize quests” but this is hardly elaborated on, and we have no way of knowing how this feature works through the demo.


### Project Documentation:
The readme overall is well-structured and informative. It was very easy to follow and was comprehensive, providing an overview of the application's purpose, features, and setup instructions. I liked how it broke down all the features and listed which phase it was implemented in, this was a very smart idea and it paints a clear picture in my head the project structure and how it evolved over the semester.

The documentation is decently approachable, it provides lots of context and descriptions for every feature and includes plenty of screenshots to clarify how the features work. The “Existing Features Implemented Before Winter 2024” section was also great at making it clearly what value and purpose their features had in the overall context of this app. Furthermore, it gives simple and beginner-friendly instructions to guide users through the app installation as seen below

“Launch Android Studio
Click on 'More Actions'
Click on Virtual Device Manager
Press the play button on the actions heading of the device listed there to boot the device
Drag and drop the .apk from your desktop onto the home screen of the virtual device
Click on the newly downloaded Thrive App to begin using the app”

As a new user this readme is very easy to follow. This is a nitpick but they provided a lot of visual aids in other sections, maybe some visual aids for the application installation section would be a nice addition. Also, maybe a table of contents to give the reader an idea of the structure before reading would be nice addition but it isn’t necessary. 

One big issue I have with it is the lack of any information about the actual backend API. They use a Django backend but don’t go into any detail about it except in the handoff document, where they don’t really give enough information about the formats of the various requests/response on Postman to their backend which would help future groups build on Thrive.


### Project Deployment:
The instructions were simple and it was easy to run the program. I didn’t encounter any bugs nor any edge cases. The documentation includes instructions on using basic features like signing up, engaging in journeys, and doing quests, and I was able to do all of this. As for testing and finding edge cases, I tried to come up with scenarios which none of them failed. An issue I have is that their documentation lacks scenarios we can try for testing or tests we can run or these features or more advanced features like notifications.

The following, in my opinion, could improve this section:
A more detailed "Getting Started" guide with screenshots.
A "Testing Guide" for users to test app features, and unit tests beyond just the deployment tests


### Misc.:
This is a great project and a very great effort! After implementing the feedback above this will be stellar! I have nothing else to say except good luck!
